# Summarizer

## Overview
The Summarizer is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of summarizing text. This project leverages natural language processing techniques to extract key information from texts, providing concise and relevant summaries.

## Features
- **Text Summarization**: Simplifies lengthy text documents into shorter, concise summaries without losing the core information.
- **File Handling**: Efficient handling of text files for summarization.
- **Language Processing**: Advanced language processing capabilities to understand and process the text.

## How to Use
1. **Setup**: Clone the repository and install any required dependencies.
2. **Running the Application**: Execute `main.py` to start the summarization process.
3. **Input**: Provide the text file you wish to summarize.
4. **Output**: Receive a summarized version of the text.

## Files in the Repository
- `file_handler.py`: Manages the reading and writing of text files.
- `language_processing.py`: Handles the processing of natural language in the text.
- `main.py`: The main script that initiates the summarization process.
- `summarization.py`: Contains the core algorithm for summarizing the text.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Additional Python libraries (list any specific libraries and versions required)
